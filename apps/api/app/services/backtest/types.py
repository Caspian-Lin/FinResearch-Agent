"""Backtest data contracts — config, results, metrics (FRA-25).

This module is the single source of truth for the in-memory shapes that flow
between the strategy, engine, and risk-metric layers. It is a typed *stub*:
the types are final, but no backtest logic lives here. The engine ``run``
loop, weight calculation, and metric computation are delivered by later
issues (engine-core, per-strategy, risk-metrics).

Contracts mirror ``docs/backtesting-methodology.md`` §接口契约 and align with
the ``packages/shared`` TypeScript types (``BacktestMetrics`` / ``BacktestRun``)
so the frontend can consume results without a second translation layer.
